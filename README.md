Last updated in June 2021. 

`baseline_model.ipynb` analyzs the baseline model described the paper. It runs the differential equation system in the paper and performs analysis of the fixed points and their stability. This script produces Fig 2 of the main text, and Fig S1 of the supplement. 

`spectrum_extension.ipynb` simulates the extension of the model where each individual is on a spectrum of social and individual learning (SM 5.1). 

`spatial_extension.ipynb` simulates the system where individuals are placed on a 2D grid and social learners are only affected by their immediate neighbors (SM 5.2)

`noise_extension.ipynb` simulates the extension of model where noise is added to the system (SM 5.3)

`opinion_strength_extension.ipynb` simulates the opinion strength extension model (SM 5.4), which considers individual learners can hold opinions $X$ and $Y$ with different strength or "stubborness". 

`my_functions.ipynb` contains core functions which are called for in multiple scripts.
